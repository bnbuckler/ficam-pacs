# Manage Access Control
----------------------------------------------------------------

### What is the Manage Access Control Playbook?

As the potential for internal and external threats to organizational security continue to grow, your agency should continue to focus on access control to protect its sensitive resources by making sure only authorized users have access.  You may find the implementation of proper access management processes challenging because of the growing number of users, systems/applications, and facilities. As the threat landscape expands and the management of access control becomes increasingly complex, youâ€™ll need a detailed strategy for resolving cybersecurity threats and controlling access to their resources in an automated fashion.

This playbook will give you the answers to several common access control questions, including:

> * What is access control?

> * What is the Access Management Framework (AMF)?
	
> * What should I consider when planning my access control strategy?

> * How do I choose the most appropriate Access Control Model for my agency?

> * What are and how do I implement the four access control life cycles?

### How is the playbook structured?

We developed this playbook into 10 individual steps, or activities. Within each step, you will find a checklist to help you perform that activity and additional guidance, like frequently asked questions (FAQs), implementation tips, or security and privacy considerations.


### How was the playbook developed?

This playbook was created using updated and migrated content that previously was found in the FICAM Roadmap and Implementation Guidance v2.0 and the Access Management Framework, developed by the ICAMSC in 2011 and 2014, respectively. We hope that the new format encourages you and your agency to contribute to additional content to support the access control management across the Federal government.


### Where can I find additional content?

The FICAM Architecture provides a high-level overview of identity management and a description of the services that deliver access management capabilities. We recommend that you visit the <a href="http://gsa.github.io/ficam-arch/" target="_blank"> FICAM Architecture</a> site to gain a basic understanding of access management and its role in broader federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM).


### How can I contribute to this playbook?

We look forward to your use and contribution to this playbook. Please visit our  <a href="http://bnbuckler.github.io/ficam-identity/contribute/" target =" _blank"> Contribute page </a> to learn how to post questions and contribute content.
