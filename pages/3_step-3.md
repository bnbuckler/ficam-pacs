The Build Phase is where the majority of the technical solution development, configuration, and testing occurs. We’ve provided a list of common activities that should occur during the Build Phase for you to follow. 

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Stand Up Development and Test Environments.** Establish development and testing environments so that PACS developers and testers can conduct build activities in an environment that does not impact the agency’s production systems.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Build/Configure Servers.** Build and/or configure servers to properly operate the PACS solution, as needed based upon the chosen implementation path.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Install Supporting Software.** Install supporting software (i.e., Commercial Off-The-Shelf [COTS] Identity Access Management [IAM] Suite) on PACS servers, as needed based upon the chosen implementation path.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Configure Supporting Software.** Configure PACS software to specifically meet the agency’s unique needs and/or perform certain functions, as needed based upon the chosen implementation path.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Implement and Assess Security Controls.** Conduct Steps 3 and 4 of the Risk Management Framework (RMF) by applying the controls identified in the requirements and design phase and by assessing the adequacy and effectiveness of the security controls and documenting the findings in an assessment report.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct Testing on Initial Build.** Perform testing on the PACS solution in a development and/or test environment to ensure that system errors are found and corrected before the solution is deployed on the agency’s network.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct Pilot Implementation Deployment.** Conduct a pilot implementation to expose a small subset of the agency’s user base to the PACS solution for the purpose of evaluating the solution’s operations against real-world requirements.
