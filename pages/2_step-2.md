-----------------------------------------------

The Requirements and Design Phase follows the Planning Phase. In this phase, you should thoroughly document the requirements for the PACS solution and define how the solution should operate within your agency’s existing infrastructure. Below, you’ll find a list of common activities you should complete as you begin the requirements and design phase.

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Gather PACS Solution Requirements.** Conduct a requirement gathering exercise with stakeholders and impacted parties at all organizational levels to document requirements of the PACS solution. These requirements are critical as they’ll be used to drive the design, build, and configuration of the PACS capability. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Validate PACS Solution Requirements.** Validate the documented requirements with the appropriate stakeholders to ensure the PACS solution is properly designed to meet your agency’s needs. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Secure Funding Sources.** Use the PACS business plan to secure funding sources for the modernization effort. You should also consider your agency’s existing investments and how to use them with this effort. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Select Security Controls.** Conduct <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/controls.html" target="_blank"> Step 2 of the Risk Management Framework (RMF). </a> Choose the appropriate security controls and document the selected controls in the security plan. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Document System Design.**Draft an initial system design document that clearly states how the system should function with your agency’s environment. The design document and associated requirements are then used during the build phase as a reference for how the PACS system should operate. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Define and Configure Provisioning Workflows.** Define provisioning workflows, which are used to determine how users are granted rights to access points and what approvals or additional steps are required. This process often involves configuring automated workflows based on existing manual processes

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop Solution Architecture.** Develop an initial solution architecture for the PACS implementation. This architecture defines the solution components and describes their interactions. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct Resource Acquisition.** With funding sources secured, conduct the process of purchasing any required hardware or software and services.

<h3><span>Implementation Tip</span></h3>
<p><span>Be sure to include ICAM requirements for modernized PACS in facility arrangements, negotiations, and the procurement process for leased space. When these requirements are introduced during the Requirements and Design Phase, an agency can more easily ensure the proper requirements are incorporated into lease agreements.</span></p>
