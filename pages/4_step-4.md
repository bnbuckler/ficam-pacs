Once you’ve configured your agency’s PACS solution and tested to ensure that it meets agency and government-wide requirements and performs appropriately, you can begin the Implementation Phase. This phase consists of activities for migration of the PACS solution from a development and test environment into the agency‘s production infrastructure. There may be an overlap in access control services provided by the old and new PACS for a period of time until the cardholder population is fully transitioned to the new PACS. We’ve provided a list of common activities that usually occur during the implementation phase.

## <span style="color: #0C5C89">**Checklist**</span>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Authorize the PACS.** Conduct Step 5 of the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/fisma/framework.html" target="_blank"> Risk Management Framework (RMF). </a> Authorize Information System by preparing and submitting the security authorization package to the authorizing official. The authorizing official chooses to accept the risk and authorize the system if the risk associated with operating the PACS is deemed acceptable.  

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct User Acceptance Training.** Conduct user acceptance testing to ensure that the PACS solution is acceptable to stakeholders and end users and performs the required functions in an appropriate manner.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct User Training.** Develop training materials and conduct user training prior to PACS deployment to ensure that users are capable of accessing their worksites without disruption.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Deploy PACS Solution to Live Production Environment.** Deploy the PACS solution on the agency’s network infrastructure and begin controlling access to facilities.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Perform Awareness and Outreach.** Conduct awareness and outreach activities in accordance with the Communications Plan developed as part of the Planning Phase. This involves actively communicating to users that a new access control system is being deployed, the benefits and efficiencies that users can expect, and any steps necessary to begin using the new system.
