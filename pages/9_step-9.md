After you’ve successfully deployed your agency’s PACS solution to a live production level, you’ll begin the Operate and Maintain Phase. This phase lasts for the remainder of the time that the PACS solution is in use and consists of ongoing management and system maintenance activities such as: conducting training, operating the PACS solution, and protecting new resources as they come online.

<h3><span>Implementation Tip</span></h3>
<p><span>Enterprise development often includes connection of multiple local PACS servers that may contain local user records. This process may involve removal of redundant accounts in instances where one person has access to multiple sites. Additionally, agencies  should have a plan for handling duplicate user records.</span></p>

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Monitor Security Controls.** Monitor Security Controls by monitoring changes to the information system and its environment of operation and conducting ongoing assessments of security controls in accordance with the monitoring strategy.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Ongoing User Training.** Continue to update and modify user training curriculums as the PACS solution matures and new technology is implemented. Conduct additional training as necessary.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Modify Provisioning Workflows.** Update provisioning workflows as business needs and access rules change over time. Changes may also be required as resource owners experience the benefits that can be provided by PACS services and provisioning workflows can be streamlined.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Conduct Hardware/Technology Refresh.** Conduct periodic updates and/or upgrades to solution hardware and other technology over the lifespan of a PACS solution as a means of extending the usable life of the solution or adding new capabilities.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Software/Firmware Refresh.** Update software and firmware to accommodate manufacturer improvements, bug fixes, or to remain compliant with the latest policies and standards.
