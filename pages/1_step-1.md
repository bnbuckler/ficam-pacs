In most if not all projects, planning is critical to avoid common problems during the execution of your project.  Below, you’ll find the activities and processes that are necessary to properly plan for a modernized PACS implementation within your agency. It includes existing standards and guidance, PACS implementation within an agency, and considerations that are necessary to properly plan for a physical access deployment within your agency.

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Begin Field Prioritization.** Begin examining agency PACS and developing field assessment criteria in order to prioritize/organize deployment of modernized PACS services to agency facilities. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop Field Integration Guide.** Develop a Field Integration Guide, a formal document used to outline the process that an agency’s physical security resources will go through to become integrated with the PACS solution. 

> <i class="fa fa-check-square-o"></i> &nbsp;**Develop PACS Migration Plan.** Develop a migration plan that outlines how the agency plans to transition its physical resources to use the modernized access control system.

<h3><span>Lesson Learned</span></h3>
<p><span>Investing in and installing multi-technology PIV card readers gives program implementers access control during the transition from agency-specific proximity cards to PIV cards. It also allows proximity cards to be issued to resolve temporary physical access challenges such as lost, stolen, or damaged PIV cards.</span></p>
